- Source code: https://github.com/jrkerr2/kerr-portfolio

## Notes on implementation and technical debt

- template from Theme Forest used as baseline, adapted for my style and content
- some content is still boilerplate as the final content of my resume and profile package are still in process
- both project application and corresponding source code repos are linked -- former in the project image, latter in the title/desc
- portoflio pages are responsive, but there are some defects at mobile/tablet sizes (working on this)
